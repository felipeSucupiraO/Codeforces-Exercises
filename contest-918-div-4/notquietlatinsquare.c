// A Latin square is a 3Ã—3 grid made up of the letters A, B, and C such that:

// in each row, the letters A, B, and C each appear once, and in each column, the letters A, B, and C each appear once.
// You are given a Latin square, but one of the letters was replaced with a question mark ?. Find the letter that was replaced.
